libx11: The only int to ptr casts occurs in IMWrap.c:96 (XcopyToArg),
the cast of a pointer is copied INSIDE another pointer. This might not be a problem unless the destination pointer is casted back to an int (the delta strategy would change the value -> divergence). Uses of XCopyToArg should be investigated. 



== Typical Casts ==

* cast of constant integers to pointers (e.g. in the libgtk-2)
  (just trash values)

*
