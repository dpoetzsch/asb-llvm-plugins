Total casts: 4 (0 casts of integer constant expressions)
 The only int to ptr casts occurs in IMWrap.c:96 (XcopyToArg),
the cast of a pointer is copied INSIDE another pointer. This might not be a problem unless the destination pointer is casted back to an int (the delta strategy would change the value -> divergence). Uses of XCopyToArg should be investigated. 

== libgtk-2 ==
Total casts: 64 (53 casts of integer constant expressions)
We suspect that the remaining 11 non-i-c-e casts are still constant values.

== libgtk-3 ==
Total casts: 61 (50 casts of integer constant expressions)
Similar to libx11, a value is stored directly in a pointer. Later use should be investigated?

== libxt ==
Total casts: 187 (160 casts of integer constant expressions)
In Varargs.c and Varget.c, a nested list is created. Each member contains three fields: A value, the type of the value, and a tag indicating wether the value is a pointer to another nested list or not. The value is stored as an int, so uses of the value as a pointer requires a cast.
This might not be a problem, but when a nested list is linked to another, a ptr to int cast has to be made, and the value shouldn't be changed.

== xedit ==
Total casts: 31 (26 casts of integer constant expressions)
The remaining 5 casts seem to be data bytes that for some reason are stored as
pointers

== xpdf ==
No casts found unit compilation fails due to semantical analysis errors

== Summary: Typical usages ==
* cast of constant integer literals to pointers (e.g. in the libgtk-2)
  (it seems just for trash values)
* pass information where ptr type is expected (might be problematic!)
