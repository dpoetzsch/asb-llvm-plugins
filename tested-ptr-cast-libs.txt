==libx11==
 The only int to ptr casts occurs in IMWrap.c:96 (XcopyToArg),
the cast of a pointer is copied INSIDE another pointer. This might not be a problem unless the destination pointer is casted back to an int (the delta strategy would change the value -> divergence). Uses of XCopyToArg should be investigated. 

== libgtk-2 ==
Total casts: 64 (53 casts of integer constant expressions)
We suspect that the remaining 11 non-i-c-e casts are still constant values.

== libgtk-3 ==
TODO



== Summary: Typical usages ==
* cast of constant integer literals to pointers (e.g. in the libgtk-2)
  (it seems just for trash values)
* pass information where ptr type is expected (might be problematic!)
